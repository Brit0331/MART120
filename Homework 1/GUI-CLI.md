GUI or Graphical User Interface is an intuitive way to interact with your computer by being able to make changes to files, folders, dives, etc.. (anything you want really)
on you computer, visually. This allows a user to see and create their orginazational structure without having to remember exactly where files are going since they can see
what they create. Now moving into CLI or Command Line Interface. This is another way to manage items on a computer but from a terminal like CMD or Powershell on Windows systems.
You still have all the functionallity that you get when using the GUI for your file structure, you just have to use a few simple commands to create/remove/rename files and folders. 
You still have all the power to choose the location as well. Though this is just a small piece of what you can do with both the GUI and CLI. One plus about CLI in my opinion is 
the sheer amount of information you're provided when working inside the CLI, this allows a developer to speed up the development process by not having to find pertinant information
through the GUI as you can have it all display right in front of you in the CLI.
