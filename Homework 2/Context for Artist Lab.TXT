So for the Artist Lab piece about what community is to you. I made this image with the mindset that two people part of the same community can be exactly the same
but come to a point where they may be tasks with an obsticale. For one it may be easier (squigly lines) and for one it may be harder (hard lines). With the brick wall
down the center, they both think they have the same challenge but don't know that they are doing different versions of it. But in the end, they are both still a community,
no matter what they do.
